This repository contains different tasks related to Java Streams. Idea is to solve each task using Java Stream API using AI assistance.


## Setup
Minimal setup is required. Tools you will need:
 - Java 11+ 
 - Maven
 - IDE (In my case IntelliJ IDEA)
 - Github Co-pilot (optional)
 
## How to run exercises
Each exercise is an jUnit test. 
You can run test from both Maven or any modern IDE. 

## Where are answers?
Each task has solution in Solution.txt file.



### Maven
To check *task1* from *Basics* package:
```
mvn surefire:test -Dtest=BasicsTest#task1
```

### IDE
After importing project press "Play" near the test you want to run.
